# Willians  Tavares

I'm an enthusiast deeply **passionate** about development, currently as Tech Lead at [Konia Tecnologia](https://konia.com.br/). With a strong foundation in C#, ASP.NET, Kotlin and Javascript. My expertise spans not only application development but also cloud servers like AWS and Azure. 🚀

Beyond my commitment to development, I had the honor of sharing my knowledge as a professor at [Senac](https://www.sp.senac.br/), teaching Interactive Languages in 2023. 👨‍🎓

**My aim is always to simplify the complex**, seeking smart solutions to challenges that arise in software development. I'm excited about collaborating on challenging projects, applying my experience and passion to craft innovative and efficient solutions. 🛠
